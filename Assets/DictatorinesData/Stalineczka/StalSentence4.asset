  description: Comrade, have you ever dreamt of taking a romantic tank ride under
    the stars? It could be a perfect setting for our friendship to blossom~! What
    do you say?
  answers:
  - answer: A tank ride might be a bit too romantic for me, comrade. Can we plan
      something more casual?
    points: -1
  - answer: I'm not really a fan of tanks, comrade. Maybe we could find another way
      to enjoy the night together?

  - answer: A T-55 ride under the stars sounds magical, comrade! Let's make it happen,
      and shells cover the battlefield!
