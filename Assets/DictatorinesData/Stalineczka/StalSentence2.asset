  description: Comrade, have you ever considered learning the art of dance? Perhaps
    a traditional Russian dance? It could be a celebration of our camaraderie~! What
    do you think?

  - answer: Dancing sounds like a babcia-pierogi, comrade! Let's give the Russian
      dance a try.

  - answer: Russian dance might be a bit too energetic for me, comrade. Can we explore
      other options?
